# The Digital Cookbook

## Introduction

The task is to develop a digital cookbook â€“ a culinary recipes repository with
simple search capabilities with an HTML interface.  The application must be
developed in Ruby on Rails and make use of SQLite3 database.


## Models

The application has two models: `Recipe` and `Ingredient`.  There is
a one-to-many association between them.

The `Recipe` model has at least following attributes: `name` and `instructions`
store textual data and `cooking_time` stores numeric data.  The `Ingredient`
model has `name` attribute which stores textual data.  Both models may have
other columns as well, e.g. when they're required by associations.

Following model validations are required:

* Recipe's `name` must be present and no longer than 100 characters.
* Recipe's `instructions` must be present and no longer than 1000 characters.
* Recipe's `cooking_time` must be present and be larger than 0.
* Ingredient's `name` must be present and no longer than 100 characters.



## Searching

When user visits a root url (GET request on `/` path), a search form is
displayed.  The form consists of:

1. input of type text labeled "Cuisine"
2. input of type text labeled "Ingredient"
3. button labeled "Search".

Clicking on "Search" executes a search request.  In the result, user is
navigated to a page which lists all the matched recipes.

If the "Cuisine" has been provided in the search form, then the result set is
limited to recipes which cuisine equals to that provided value.

If the "Ingredient" has been provided in the search form, then the result set is
limited to recipes which have an ingredient with name which equals to that
provided value.

If both fields have been left out blank, the result set includes all the recipes
in the database.  In case no recipes have been matched, then "No recipes found"
should be displayed.

Every matched recipe should be displayed in a way which includes its name,
instructions, cooking time (followed with "min" suffix) and names of the
ingredients.

Matching recipes and ingredients may be performed either in a case-sensitive or
a case-insensitive manner, both will pass the tests.  Neither the order of
displayed recipes matters.

See integration tests for more details.  In order to simulate user's
interactions, [Capybara](http://jnicklas.github.io/capybara/) has been employed.
That said, knowledge of this gem is not necessary to understand the test suite.


## Routes, controllers and views

There are no restrictions on controllers, routes and views, except for these
which can be concluded from the search use case.  Any HTML version and DOM
structure works as long as it provides the functionality described.
